# Hacktoberfest
A simple repo to help first timers to start their open source journey.

It is October, or should I say it Hacktober? October is a month long celebration of open source! If you are reading this you are must probably looking to make your first contribution to the community of open source!

## Why Contribute to Open Source?
I think since you are already here you must be knowing why contributing to open source is a great idea :) But I think this section can turn out to be a great way for you to start contributing (yes, it is that easy!). As an example I would add one point below, others are open to be contributed by you people, the first-timers! 
* It helps you be a better programmer while helping contribute to the community!
* You get to work on real software used by millions of people!
* Start small, like even fixing typos can be a good starting point!
* You will get to meet amazing people!
* Want something in your favourite OSS? You can do it yourself :)

## Getting Started 
Since you know why contributing to an open source project might be a great idea, now your next step is to **choose a project you want to contribute to.**
If you take my suggestion on this topic of where to start, I would say go no further. [This](https://github.com/nitin-singla/hacktoberfest) repo itself is a great place to start since you need to start somewhere ^â€¿^ 

But, hey, everyone has their own journey, maybe you are a seasoned programmer who is just embarking on their open source journey, then my suggestion would be to go for a project/library you might already be working on, since you already understand the nuances of it and it would be much more easier and fun to contribute there.
